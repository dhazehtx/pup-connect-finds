# MY PUP - Dog Listing Platform

## Overview

MY PUP is a comprehensive dog listing platform connecting dog lovers with breeders, rescues, and individual sellers. It serves as a marketplace for buying and selling dogs, offering integrated messaging, educational resources, and safety features. The platform aims to provide a trusted and efficient environment for dog adoption and sales, with a vision for substantial market potential in the pet industry. Key capabilities include a robust search experience, a consistent design system, and a highly responsive user interface with reliable navigation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Important: Preserve all existing Supabase functionality**
- Keep all Supabase client calls, authentication, and storage intact
- Do not remove or replace any existing Supabase integration
- Supabase remains the primary backend service for this application

## System Architecture

The application employs a full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

**Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite for build tooling.
**Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript.
**Database**: PostgreSQL, managed with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
**Authentication & Real-time**: Supabase Auth for user management and real-time subscriptions.
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS, augmented by the shadcn/ui component library.
**Payments**: Stripe integration for monetization, subscriptions, and commission tracking.

### Core Architectural Decisions:
- **Modular Component Structure**: Frontend components are organized by feature (e.g., messaging, listings).
- **State Management**: React Context for global state (Auth, Theme) and React Query for server state.
- **RESTful API**: Backend exposes RESTful endpoints, with handlers organized by feature.
- **ORM-driven Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM ensures type safety and a schema-first approach for database interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive UI components and bottom navigation.
- **Authentication Flow**: Supabase handles user authentication, profile synchronization with PostgreSQL, and protected routes. Includes guest browsing, session management (with timeout and refresh), and secure token handling.
- **Scalable Features**: Designed for real-time messaging, robust listing management, advanced search with AI recommendations, fraud detection, comprehensive refund and commission tracking, and extensive social features (e.g., likes, comments, following, saved posts).
- **Admin & Moderation**: Dedicated admin panel with detailed logging, user reporting, abuse protection, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
- **Compliance**: GDPR and privacy compliance features including data export, account deletion, privacy policy, and cookie consent.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Implemented a comprehensive Tailwind design token system with automated compliance enforcement, including a standardized color palette (primarily blue and white), typography scale, spacing grid, and animation tokens. The search experience is Instagram-style with comprehensive database coverage, advanced keyboard navigation, visual consistency, and full mouse/touch interaction support. A centralized theme system with CSS variables ensures consistent styling across all components (e.g., buttons, tabs, cards).
- **Technical Implementations**: Solutions for performance issues include stabilizing filter states with `useMemo`, serializing query keys, and using `useCallback` for handlers. Navigation issues were resolved by stabilizing `AuthContext`, fixing React Hooks order violations, and implementing comprehensive navigation guard logic to prevent loops and redundant redirects. Timeout diagnostics and non-blocking fallback UIs were added to prevent silent hangs during data fetching. The Instagram-style search implementation features a consolidated StickyHeader with SearchBar integration and proper button elements for accessibility and mobile touch support. Admin shield access is implemented with loading state management and multi-field role checking. Monetization system with Stripe integration, platform commissions, boosted listings, and provider subscriptions is in place. Legal compliance with Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and legal checkbox components is completed.
